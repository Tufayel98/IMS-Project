# Inventory Management System

This is my Inventory Management System project. Which showcases the skills I have managed to gain during the last 5 weeks training with QA Academy.
The language used to write up the program was Java, along with storing and creating the Database in MYSQL which was later connected and transported 
into Java. The IMS allows users to perform a basic CRUD functionality. The system accepts orders which are made and then gives them an Items ID, Quantitiy and the Total cost.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
